# Getting Director's approval for a new W3C maturity level (aka transition requests)

For all requests to advance a specification to a new [maturity level](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#maturity-levels) other than [Note](), the Working Group must obtain [Director approval](https://www.w3.org/Consortium/Process/#transition-reqs). This is a  repository for managing W3C spec transitions. It contains the transition requirements document, available from [Organize a Technical Report Transition](https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions), and an issues tracker for managing transition requests. Tags are used to manage the transitions, keeping track of who has the “ball”.

Select one of the transition templates below:

* First Public Working Draft: [FPWD transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* First Public Working|Interest Note: [FPNote transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Ordinary Working Draft: no Director's approval needed, just use Echidna.
* Ordinary Working|Interest Group Note: no Director's approval needed, just use Echidna.
* Candidate Recommendation: [CR transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Updating a Candidate Recommendation with only editorial changes: no Director's approval needed, just use Echidna.
* Updating a Candidate Recommendation with substantive changes: [Updated CR transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Proposed Recommendation: [PR transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Proposal to Supersede a Recommendation: [Superseded transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Proposal to Obsolete a Recommendation: [Obsoleted transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)
* Recommendation: Due to the need to look at the AC Review comments, those transitions are done by the Team separately
* Edited Recommendation: [Edited REC transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new/choose)

If you're not sure what transition template to use, check out our [next step finder](https://w3c.github.io/transitions/nextstep.html) to see your choices.

## Further Guidance

  * If you're not sure how to fill the template properly, see [Organize a Technical Report Transition](https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions).
  * If you need to convey Member-confidential information, start a thread on w3c-archive@w3.org and link it from your issue; lists.w3.org's access control will manage permissions. Use w3t-archive@w3.org instead for Team-confidential infos.
  * Your WG code is your WG's preferred (unique) abbreviation: it is included in the title template to help you search for transition requests relevant to your WG and manage the official or unofficial pestering of whoever has the “ball”.
  * Assign your editor(s) and staff contact(s) to the transition request issue to facilitate automatic pestering.
  * Don't forget to tag/untag “Awaiting ...” so that issues show up in the appropriate to-do queues.
  * Issues get closed once publication is complete *and* relevant announcements are posted.
