# Getting Team verification for a new W3C maturity level (aka transition requests)

For all requests to advance a specification to a new [maturity level](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#maturity-levels) other than [Note](), the Working Group must obtain [Team verification](https://www.w3.org/policies/process/#transition-reqs). This is a  repository for managing the verification workflow when advancing on the W3C Recommendation track. It contains the transition requirements document, available from [Organize a Technical Report Transition](https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions/), and an issues tracker for managing transition requests. Tags are used to manage the transitions, keeping track of who has the “ball”. Notifications are sent by email to various mailing lists, include [public-transition-announce](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Public/public-transition-announce/) and [chairs](https://lists.w3.org/Archives/Member/chairs/).

Select one of the transition templates below:

* First Public Working Draft: [FPWD transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new?template=6.3.05-publishing-first-public-working-draft.md)

* Transitioning to Candidate Recommendation: [CR transition](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new?template=6.3.07-candidate-recommendation.md)

* Request a W3C Decision for a new Recommendation: Due to the need to look at the AC Review comments, those transitions are  [done by the Team](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/new?template=6.3.09.3-recommendation.md) separately. But the Team does still track those requests in [transition issues](https://github.com/w3c/transitions/issues/).

If you're not sure what transition template to use, check out our [next step finder](https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions/nextstep.html) to see your choices.

## Further Guidance

  * Start with [Organize a Technical Report Transition](https://www.w3.org/Guide/transitions/) for more detailed guidance on how to complete the templates.
  * If you need to convey Member-confidential information, start a thread on w3c-archive@w3.org and link it from your issue; lists.w3.org's access control will manage permissions. Use w3t-archive@w3.org instead for Team-confidential infos.
  * Copy your chairs, your editor(s), and staff contact(s) to the transition request issue to facilitate automatic pestering.
  * Untag "Awaiting ..." if you intend to continue editing the issue before requesting action; you will need to add these back later.
  * Issues get closed once publication is complete *and* relevant announcements are posted.

## How does the monitoring work?

You may [add your own hook](https://labs.w3.org/transition-issues-bot/doc/hook) to get those notifications.
